# PROJECT 1: TEXT GENERATION: AI Storyteller â€“ Text Generation with GPT-2

This project demonstrates a simple AI storytelling system using the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face Transformers. It generates creative continuations of a story based on a user-provided prompt and explores how various text generation parameters influence the style and output of the generated content.

## <ins>Features</ins>

- Load and use the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face

- Accept a text prompt from the user

- Generate a creative story continuation

- Experiment with different generation settings:

  -  1.temperature

  -  2.top_k

  -  3.max_length

- Display generated outputs clearly for comparison

- Provide a short reflection on how parameter changes affect storytelling

## <ins>Objectives</ins>

- Understand how GPT-2 generates text

- Learn how generation parameters impact creativity and coherence

- Gain hands-on experience using Hugging Face's transformers library

## <ins>Deliverables</ins>

- A Jupyter Notebook containing:

- GPT-2 loading and prompt input

- At least 3 different user prompts and generated stories

- Experimentation with generation settings

- A 4-5 line reflection on parameter impact

## <ins>Requirements

- Python 3.6+

- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

- Install the required libraries:

  -  pip install transformers torch

## <ins>Reflection</ins>

A short section comparing how changes to temperature and top_k affect the tone, randomness, and creativity of the generated text.
