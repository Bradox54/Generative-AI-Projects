## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bradox54/Generative-AI-Projects.git
   cd Generative-AI-Projects
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
